    """Cut one file per clip in ``analysis`` into ``out_dir``.

    Args:
        video_path: The downloaded source.
        analysis: A ``VideoAnalysis`` (anything with ``.clips``).
        out_dir: Directory to write clips into — pass a per-job workspace from
            ``helpers.workspace.job_workspace``. Created if absent. Existing
            files are left alone; this function never deletes anything.
        ffmpeg_bin: Override the ffmpeg binary. Defaults to ``resolve_ffmpeg()``.

    Returns:
        One dict per clip, carrying the LLM's reasoning through alongside the
        file. ``index`` is 0-based and stable, so callers can build a
        deterministic, retry-safe storage key from it.

    Note:
        ``-c copy`` is a stream copy: near-instant and lossless, but cuts snap
        to the nearest keyframe, so a clip can start a second or two off its
        requested timestamp. Re-encoding would be frame-accurate at real CPU
        cost. Stream copy is the deliberate v1 choice.
